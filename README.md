This Repo based on Chalmers SSY236 course Decision-making for Autonomous system and Tiago robot.
Covers the following topics:
* Introduction to embodied intelligence, as part of a Cognitive system.
* Tree-based learning approaches such as Decision trees.
* Explanation-based learning methods, commonly known as Explainable-AI (XAI). This will include an introduction to knowledge representation and reasoning methods.
* High-level robot programming. This will include the design and implementation of different modules such as perception, learning, and decision-making for an autonomous system. Most of the implementation will be done in C++.
